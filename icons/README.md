# BreatheWork Icons

This directory contains the icon files for the BreatheWork Chrome extension.

For a production release, you would need to add the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows taskbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Requirements

- Format: PNG with transparency
- Colors: Should match the app's breathing/wellness theme
- Design: Simple, recognizable symbol related to breathing (lungs, circle, etc.)
- Backgrounds: Transparent for proper integration

## Placeholder Icons

The current setup uses placeholder references. For testing purposes, you can create simple colored squares or use any PNG icons of the appropriate sizes.

- Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
